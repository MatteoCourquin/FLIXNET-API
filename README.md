# **<span style='color:red'>FLIXNET</span>**-API <em style='font-size: 13px'> by Matteo Courquin </em>

## API's :

For this project I used 2 api's. Firstly https://www.tvmaze.com/api which is a movie api, secondly https://openweathermap.org/api which is a weather api.

## Thinking :

I started with the Movies API. I displayed them and styled it all with scss. Then I thought about what I could give as added value to my project. 

I thought that people don't go out enough, that's why depending on the weather a message is displayed and access to the API is restricted.

## Coding :

* <span style='color:orange'>HTML</span> is nothing more classic. It is well stored by section.

* For <span style='color:blue'>CSS</span>, I chose to use the SCSS preprocessor to optimize my code and better structure my files.

* The <span style='color:yellow'>JavaScript</span> that makes up most of this project is much more organized considering all of its code.
I start by calling all the variables and constants I need. Then I create my functions with parameters.
Then I call on all this in order to make everything functional.
To make my site dynamic, I use the two api's with the fetch method and I retrieve the data to then use them in the parameters of my functions that I declared beforehand.
